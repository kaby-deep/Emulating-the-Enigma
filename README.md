# Emulating-the-Enigma
                                ********************ABSTRACT********************
The Enigma machine is a cipher device developed and used in the early to mid-20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic, and military 
communication. It was employed extensively by Nazi Germany during 
World War II, in all branches of the German military. The Enigma 
machine was considered so secure that it was used to encipher the most 
top-secret messages, secure as in nearly impossible odds of 1 in 
158,962,555,217,826,360,000 to intercept and decipher an extremely 
complicated encrypted code
The project aims to emulate the working of the infamous device and the 
internal working of the machine. The project implements the components 
and their mechanisms using Python as the language and explains each and 
every step that goes into encrypting a message typed into the machine.
Every component is emulated on a digital form keeping the genuineness of 
its working mechanism.
To make the scrambling process more understandable, an interactive 
interface is designed with Pygame (a Python Module) which depicts the 
working of every component and how the message is scrambled in each 
and every step of the encryption process. The project’s sole purpose is to 
display the exceptional intelligence that went into designing the device 
which was way ahead of its time and which was once thought impossible 
to break. The project is also a throwback to the genius Alan Turing who 
broke The Enigma with his machine ‘The Bombe’ which eventually 
helped the Allies win the World War II
